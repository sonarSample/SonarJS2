/**
 * Analyzes a file containing JS snippets
 *
 * Analyzing embedded JS is part of analyzing inline JavaScript code
 * within various file formats: YAML, HTML, etc. The function first starts by parsing
 * the whole file to validate its syntax and to get in return an abstract syntax
 * tree. This abstract syntax tree is then used to extract embedded JavaScript
 * code. As files might embed several JavaScript snippets, the function
 * builds an ESLint SourceCode instance for each snippet using the same utility
 * as for building source code for regular JavaScript analysis inputs. However,
 * since a file can potentially produce multiple ESLint SourceCode instances,
 * the function stops to the first JavaScript parsing error and returns it without
 * considering any other. If all abstract syntax trees are valid, the function
 * then proceeds with linting each of them, aggregates, and returns the results.
 *
 * The analysis requires that global linter wrapper is initialized.
 *
 * @param input the analysis input
 * @param language the language of the file containing the JS code
 * @returns the analysis output
