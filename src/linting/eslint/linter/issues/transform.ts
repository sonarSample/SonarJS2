 * Transforms ESLint messages into SonarQube issues

 * The result of linting a source code requires post-linting transformations

 * paths, decoding issues with secondary locations as well as converting
 * quick fixes.
 *
 * Besides issues, a few metrics are computed during linting in the form of
 * an internal custom rule execution, namely cognitive complexity and symbol
 * highlighting. These custom rules also produce issues that are extracted.
 *
 * Transforming an ESLint message into a SonarQube issue implies:
 * - extracting UCFG rule file paths
 * - converting ESLint messages into SonarQube issues
 * - converting ESLint fixes into SonarLint quick fixes
 * - decoding encoded secondary locations
 * - normalizing issue locations
 *
 * @param messages ESLint messages to transform
 * @param ctx contextual information
 * @returns the linting result
